title = "Unified Land Model Simulations (ULM) for western U.S. hydrologic simulations using MACA-Livneh CMIP5 forcings."
summary = "This archive contains daily timestep and 1/16-deg resolution hydrologic fluxes and state variables for the western United States produced by Unified Land Model Simulations (ULM) model simulations. The simulations were forced by Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA, Abatzoglou, 2012) statistical downscaling of Global Climate Models and trained to Livneh et al (2013) gridded surface observations. Four downscaled meteorological variables were used at a daily timestep: (1) maximum temperature, (2) minimum temperature, (3) precipitation, and (4) average wind speed. The downscaled forcings were constructed using 365-day global climate model (GCM) outputs from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). For each GCM, the simulation time extent included one historical period (1950-2005) and a future period (2006-2099/2100). For the future period, two emission scenarios were used (RCP 4.5/8.5). Feb. 29 leap days have been added to the forcing dataset by averaging Feb-28 and Mar-1 daily forcings for a given leap year."
